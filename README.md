# Syscomm Notes
*A web app revival of [an old project](https://github.com/greysdawn/syscomm)*

## About
**Syscomm** is intended to be an all-in-one, system-oriented notes app. Once finished, it'll include headmate management, switch tracking, a notes system, and maybe even direct headmate chats ðŸ‘€  
There will also be options to share fronter information through [semi-]public profiles. These will have granular permissions systems similar to PK, with overrides for "friend" systems

**Note:** *This app is not based on the InnerWorlds or Simply Plural system-oriented apps.* These are features we hoped to include in the original version of Syscomm, but didn't have the time, technical ability, or know-how to include. The general intention of the app is for system communication- features like system management and switch tracking are big parts of that. You're free to point out similarities, but please note that this is and has always been intended to be an entirely separate app!

## Other info
At the moment, this app is **not** online. That should change soon!

If you'd like to contribute, you're welcome to! Do note that this app *is* currently in active development however, and thus a lot of changes made be done between commits. Pull requests are welcome, but not entirely recommended until a more stable version is ready for production
